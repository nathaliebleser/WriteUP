Not to be or to be, that is the question, how come I've never heard of this before?
Let it come to be known: this is before I ever believed in you, before I knew what you were, before I came to intrically know the depths of you. You were what you were, deep, unknown, beautiful in its mystery. Can someone explain how that changed? is it not the worst when people ask someone else to explain? Can we not explain the world to ourselves instead? I believed I could. And maybe that was my biggest mistake. Someone not too long ago told me about this: in newer areas around town, bears have been appearing and making a fuss.
