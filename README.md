# WriteUP
WriteUP is short for Write to Level UP.
It's main use is to increase motivation to write as much as possible by using a 'Numbers go up' principle.

## Other features
Because writers can be very particular about the environment they like to work in, WriteUP has a dark mode as well as ways to hide unwanted statistics.
