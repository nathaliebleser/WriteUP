# WriteUP
WriteUP is short for Write to Level UP.
Its main use is to increase motivation to write as much as possible by using a 'Numbers go up' principle.

Why would that be useful? Who might want that? Check out [NaNoWriMo](https://nanowrimo.org).

## Features
WriteUP has three main ways to use it:
- Wordcount-based session
- Timelimit-based session
- Unlimited session

For all these, WriteUP will count the points produced by the written words, and at the end of the session, will log the achieved points into a personal leaderboard. 
Additionally, WriteUP will count the total amount of words ever written, and assign a level to the user.

No written words are sent across the internet. However, they are saved to local storage between website loads to allow recovery of written text in case the website connection is lost.

## Other features

Because writers can be very particular about the environment we like to work in, WriteUP has a dark mode as well as settings to hide unwanted statistics.
